## Digital to Reality: Accident Detection in Video Surveillance with Deep Learning Techniques

This study was performed for the Masters thesis to detect accidents from surveillance videos and create summarized videos centered around the accident. Two datasets were considered for the pupose of this study - Synthetic videos dataset and Real-time videos dataset. The dataset videos were manually selected from YouTube and downloaded using PyTube.

The model will be trained on synthetic dataset and then tested on real-time dataset. Various experiments were performed using YOLOv5s to detect accidents from the videos. The model that resulted in the highest mAP scores was selected as the best model. Post model selection, event based video summarization techniques were applied to generate short videos centered around one accident.
